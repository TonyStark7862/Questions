Yes, I strictly followed the content from the **document images** you provided at the beginning. **No extra concepts** were added beyond what was present in those images.  

Now, I’ll **enhance the questionnaire further** by:  
1. **Providing context explanations** for terms like **model tier, materialistic aspects, model drift, adversarial attacks, etc.**  
2. **Ensuring clarity** so that people answering the questionnaire don't need external references.  
3. **Maintaining structure & depth** while sticking **only** to the document content.

# **AI Solution Assessment Questionnaire**  
This questionnaire assesses **AI governance, compliance, performance, and risk mitigation**. Each question requires a **Yes/No** response unless otherwise specified. **Explanations are provided alongside complex terms** to ensure clarity.

## **Section 1: AI Model Classification & Risk Tiers**  

### **Context: AI Model Tiers & Risk Classification**  
A **model tier** categorizes AI solutions based on risk, sensitivity, and business impact. High-risk AI models influence critical decisions (e.g., healthcare, finance), while low-risk models perform non-critical tasks (e.g., recommendation systems).  

1. **Has your AI model been assigned a risk tier (low, medium, high) before deployment, based on predefined organizational criteria?**  
2. **Does the risk assessment framework evaluate the AI model based on its use case, decision impact, and sensitivity of data involved?**  
3. **Is there an approval process where a governance team verifies AI model classification before deployment?**  
4. **For high-risk AI solutions, has a mitigation plan been developed to handle failures or incorrect decisions?**  
5. **Are all stakeholders informed about the model tier and the associated risks before deployment?**

## **Section 4: Model Performance & Monitoring**  

### **Context: Model Drift & Monitoring**  
- **Model drift** occurs when real-world data **evolves**, reducing AI prediction accuracy.  
- **Monitoring** involves tracking model **accuracy, fairness, and efficiency** over time.  

17. **Is there an automated system to detect model drift and trigger alerts?**  
18. **Has a threshold been defined for when the model should be retrained due to performance drops?**  
19. **Does the AI system provide confidence scores for predictions to measure reliability?**
