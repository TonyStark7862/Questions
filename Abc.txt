1. **Model Acceptance by Industry**  
   *Does your AI solution use a market-recognized algorithm, or does it rely on non-standard assumptions and inputs?*  
   **Context:** AI models that use widely accepted algorithms (e.g., decision trees) are generally considered less risky compared to those based on non-standard methodologies, which may require additional validation and oversight.  

2. **Sensitivity to Model Assumptions and Expert Judgment Inputs**  
   *Does your AI model rely on a high number of hyperparameters and expert judgment inputs?*  
   **Context:** Models with numerous hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of layers) and reliance on expert inputs are inherently more sensitive to assumptions, increasing the risk associated with incorrect or biased decision-making.  

3. **Nature and Quality of Data and Sensitivity to Opaque Inputs**  
   *Does your AI model use complex data structures, unstructured data, or opaque parameters such as proxy variables?*  
   **Context:** Models that use high-quality structured data are typically lower risk, whereas those relying on complex, unstructured, or proxy data may introduce uncertainty and increase overall model risk.  

4. **Model Performance**  
   *Is your AI model capable of maintaining performance under extreme conditions or varying market inputs?*  
   **Context:** AI models should be evaluated for robustness under different operational scenarios. Poor performance under stress conditions can indicate a higher risk factor, requiring mitigation strategies.  

5. **Quality of Model Infrastructure**  
   *Does your AI solution include an automated model infrastructure to minimize operational errors?*  
   **Context:** Automated model pipelines that ensure compliance, documentation, and rigorous testing before deployment reduce the risk of operational failures and increase model reliability.  

6. **Model Dependency**  
   *Does your AI model depend on complex architectures or multiple feeder models for decision-making?*  
   **Context:** Models that rely on multiple dependencies can introduce additional risks due to cascading failures, integration issues, or compounded errors, making risk management more critical.
